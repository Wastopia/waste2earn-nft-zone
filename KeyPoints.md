Key Integration Points

Authentication:

The AuthContext handles user authentication with Internet Identity
The authenticated identity is used for all canister calls that require authentication


NFT Display and Interaction:

NFT data is fetched from the canister using methods like icrc7_tokens, icrc7_token_metadata, etc.
The NFTContext provides access to all NFT-related functionality
Token metadata follows the ICRC-97 metadata standard as shown in your deploy.sh script


Transactions:

Transfer functionality uses icrc7_transfer method
Approvals use icrc37_approve_tokens and icrc37_approve_collection methods
The frontend automatically handles the proper formatting of canister parameters


Admin Features:

Admin functionality like minting new NFTs is protected by principal check
Minting uses the icrcX_mint method from your canister



Testing the Integration

View NFT Collection:

Navigate to the Gallery page to see all NFTs
No authentication required for viewing


Transfer & Approve NFTs:

Connect with Internet Identity
Go to the NFT details page and use the transfer or approve buttons
Only NFT owners can perform these actions


Admin Features:

Login with an admin principal
Access the Admin page to mint new NFTs and manage the collection



This frontend is designed to work seamlessly with your ICRC7 implementation, following the standard interfaces while providing a user-friendly experience for NFT management.
